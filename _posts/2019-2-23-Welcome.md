It is great to have you join me on my site. It's such an amazing thing to look back and see how far I have come. I surely would never think 10 years ago that I would be a developer by trade, but I am estatic to be one now! 

This is a fairly simple website that uses Github Pages to host, because I am cheap and do not plan on regularly updating my blog/website. 

However, I do enjoy finding new ways to create better web content. 

A little about me, I am currently 29 years old, I have two children Lincoln who is almost a month old, and Piper who will be two years old in June. My wife's name is Penni and we will be married four years in July! We currently reside in Louisville KY with our pup Sadie. 

I am an alumni of both Boyce College & The Software Guild. I have my Associates in Biblical & Theological Studies and I focused on .NET/C# in the online bootcamp at the Guild. I have been professionally working as a full stack developer since March 2018, and I currently work at Louisville Geek on their Web Development Team.
